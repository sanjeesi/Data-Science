        "- **Visualize** the trained tree by using **max_depth=3** as an initial tree depth to get a feel for the fitment and then increase the depth.\n",
        "- Balance the dataset before training to prevent the tree from being biased toward the classes that are dominant\n",
        "- Use **min_samples_split** or **min_samples_leaf** to ensure that multiple samples influence every decision in the tree, by controlling which splits will be considered.\n",
